# MakerPortfolio

My Data Science internship and Professional Certificate Program inspired me to dive headlong into the world of data visualization. I was eager to apply my newly acquired skills to model compelling datasets.

Minard's Graphic – Carte Figurative – blew me away and opened my eyes to the world of data visualization. My first foray was to recreate this visual masterpiece in the statistical programming language, R.

As a James Bond aficionado, when I discovered dataset tracking several data points from every James Bond movie, I was curious to apply my skills to one of my childhood heroes. The dataset tracks Main Actor, Number of Kills, and Number of Martinis Consumed among others factors.

The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my data visualization skills.
