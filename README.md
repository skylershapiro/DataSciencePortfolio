# Data Science Portfolio - Visualization
The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my data visualization skills in R.

My Data Science internship and Professional Certificate Program inspired me to dive headlong into the world of data visualization. I was eager to apply my newly acquired skills to model compelling datasets.

Minard's Graphic, which depicts the tragedy of Napoleon's March to Moscow, was my first foray into the area. My eyes were opened to the world of data visualization.

As a James Bond aficionado, when I discovered dataset tracking several data points from every James Bond movie, I was curious to apply my skills to one of my childhood heroes. The dataset tracks the Main Actor, Number of Kills, and Number of Martinis Consumed among other factors.
